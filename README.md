# Environment

This project aims to setup everything I need for my development and work environment, including but not limited to software, configuration and other customizations.

A secondary goal is to get a better understading of Linux, and I have therefore limited the project scope to simple `bash` scripts. Everything is this project targets my preferred distrubution [OpenSUSE Tumbleweed](https://www.opensuse.org/#Tumbleweed) and is unlikely to work on any other distrubution.

> WARNING! I do not recommend this approach for any production environment. There are better tools, like [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html), for that usecase.
